  ## Description
  This was originally a fully functioning mongoDB app that I have converted to use Mern and apollo/graphql. This allows you to log in, search up books, and then save books to your accounts so that you could make a reading list! You can even remove books from your profile if you read them, or decide that you don't like them.
